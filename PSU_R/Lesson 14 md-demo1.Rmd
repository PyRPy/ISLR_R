## Analysis of my data

#### about the data


#### goal
Notice the above three lines are different levels of headings.

```{r}
eb <- read.delim("~/DataAnalysis_H/Examples_R/PSU_R/Data/electric bill.txt")

summary(eb)
```

This data looks OK.

```{r make-plot,echo=FALSE}
plot(kwh~avgT,data=eb)
```


Regression model of usage as a function of temp....

```{r}
m1<-lm(kwh ~ avgT, data = eb)
summary(m1)$coeff
```

The fit is OK - the R^2^ is `r signif(summary(m1)$adj.r.squared,4)`.  
The above value is dynamically linked to the data, so if I change the data or the model, the R^2^ value will change also.
