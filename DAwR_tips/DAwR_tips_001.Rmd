```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Difference between 'paste' and 'paste0'
```{r}
res = paste("My", "Poem", "is", "Story", "Telling")
res
```

## if you use paste0()
```{r}
res = paste0("My", "Poem", "is", "Story", "Telling")
res
```

## 0 after paste, means there is 'nothing'
